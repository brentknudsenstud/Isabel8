                        <p>Inside Jordan Burke's family garage, with a bass, an electric keyboard and an old amp, best friends Saya Mento and Burke jammed to the classic songs of Journey and The Beatles experimenting with different riffs trying to create their own sound. They knew they had something special that first night when they could play off each other like they had been playing with each other for years. That was the early winter of 2007 in Provo, Utah, a place they still call home. Later they added Saya's high school classmate Rocky Whiteside to the mix as their lead vocalist and eventual frontman.</p>

                        <p>Isabel 8 just started touring South America with key concerts slated for Rio DeJaniero, Brazil, Santiago, Chile, Bogota, Colombia, Lima, Peru, Buenos Aires, Argentina and Quito Ecuador. Last year they made stops in Europe like London, Paris, and Rome. In addition to Burke, Mento, and Whiteside, their band members include drummer Theodore Miner and lead guitarist Bryce Chawsta. Chawsta is equally adept at orchestral stringed instruments like the violin, which influenced them to play with a full orchestra at a concert in London during their European tour.</p>
